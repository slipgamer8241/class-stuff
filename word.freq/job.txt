Bible in English, published by the Jewish Publication Society of America, 1917 Edition.
Considered a masterpiece of world literature, “the book of Job is a sustained reflection on the
nature of genuine religious faith. It squarely faces the possibility that in the grand scheme of
things God neither rewards persons for their faith and virtue nor punishes them for lack
thereof. At the heart of the inquiry lies the problem of evil: if God is all-good and all-powerful,
why do bad things happen to good people? Will the apparent injustices of this life ultimately
be balanced by a cosmic justice? And the answer that the book of Job gives to these questions
– controversy. At the outset of the book, the virtuous Job suffers the death of his ten
children and the devastation of his property. Faithfully humble at first, Job cries out in
resignation.” What does the story of Job say about the Jewish issue of suffering? Along with
Proverbs, Job is part of Judaism “wisdom literature.” While Proverbs attempts to understand
the moral and physical universe, Job wrestles with the enigmas of the moral order. As a
divinely ordained moral order, the issue of choice and free will are presupposed within this
order; hence the need for humanity to have laws, seek justice and adhere to a moral world.
